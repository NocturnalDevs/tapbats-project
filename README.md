   Run this command in the root folder (not `backend` or `frontend`):  
   ```bash
   pip install -e .
   ```

2. **Navigate to the Backend Directory**  
   Move into the `backend` directory:  
   ```bash
   cd backend
   ```

3. **Install Dependencies**  
   Install the required Python dependencies:  
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Create Database Tables**  
   Run the `create_tables.py` script to set up the database tables:  
   ```bash
   python create_tables.py
   ```

5. **Edit the `.env` File**  
   Update the `.env` file in the `backend` directory with your database credentials:  
   ```bash
   DATABASE_URL=postgresql://your_username:your_password@localhost/your_database_name
   ```

6. **Run the Backend Server**

## Git Workflow for Development and Deployment

To manage changes between your **development device** and **deployment device**, follow this Git workflow:

### **Development Device**
1. **Stage Changes**:
   ```bash
   git add .
   ```

2. **Commit Changes**:
   ```bash
   git commit -m "Your commit message"
   ```

3. **Push to `develop` Branch**:
   ```bash
   git push origin develop
   ```

### **Deployment Device**
4. **Pull from `develop` Branch**:
   ```bash
   git pull origin develop
   ```

### **Optional: Merge `develop` into `main`**
5. **Switch to `main` Branch**:
   ```bash
   git checkout main
   ```

6. **Merge `develop` into `main`**:
   ```bash
   git merge develop
   ```

7. **Push `main` Branch**:
   ```bash
   git push origin main
   ```

### **Deployment Device (Again)**
8. **Pull from `main` Branch**:
   ```bash
   git pull origin main
   ```

---

## Notes
- Use the `develop` branch for ongoing development and testing.
- Use the `main` branch for stable, deployable code.
- Always **pull before pushing** to avoid conflicts.
